The columns are:
* _Maker:_ is the name of the TeX maker;
* _Type:_ is the language of implementation;
* _Date:_ is the date of the last update on CTAN;
* _Supported Tools:_ are the tools that are used/invoked to produce the output;
* _Detect Changes:_ indicates if the TeX maker is able to detect changes in source files, and avoid to re-compile when the files have not changed. Three types of files are considered:
** TeX files (@.tex@),
** BibTeX files (@.bib@), and
** source images that are included in the document (@.png@, @.jpg@, @.pdf@, @.ps@, @.eps@...);
* _Automatic File Conversions:_ indicates if the TeX maker is able to produce a picture that could be included in a TeX document (usually: PS, PDF or picture formats) from a source format that could not be directly include in the TeX document. The formats of these source pictures are specified. Three output formats are detailled:
** PS, PDF or png: the tool is able to convert a source file to one of these three formats,
** TeX: the tool is able to create a TeX file from the source file,
** PSTeX/PDFTeX: the tools is able to produce a PS or a PDF file with embedded TeX macros.
* _Export to Elsevier:_ Elsevier is a scientific publisher who permits to upload TeX white-papers for publication. After uploading the source files, the Elsevier website is running TeX on it, and give a compilation feedback. This column indicates if the tools is able to create a version of the document that is fitting the recommendations:
** to use only one TeX file,
** to have all the included figures in the same directory as as the TeX file, and
** to replace the references to bibliography files by inlined bib items inside the main TeX file.
* _Editor Plugin:_ indicates if a plugin is provided for TeX editors. Note that several editors such as TeXworks do not need to have a specific plugin to use the makers in the table.
