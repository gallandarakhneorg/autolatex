=head1 NAME

autolatex - compile TeX documents

=head1 SYNOPSIS

autolatex [options] F<command> [F<command> ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AutoLaTeX is a tool for managing small to large sized LaTeX documents. The user can easily perform all required steps to do such tasks as: produce a PDF file or view the document. AutoLaTeX will keep track of files that have changed and how to run the various programs that are needed to produce the output. One of the best feature of AutoLaTeX is to provide translator rules (a.k.a. translators) to automatically generate the drawings which will be included into the PDF from different source formats, such as SVG, GNU Plot, etc.

As a quick example, consider a document with a single LaTeX file F<mydoc.tex>, as its input. Without AutoLaTeX, to produce a F<.pdf> file, you might use the following sequence of commands:

     F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
     F<bibtex mydoc.tex>
     F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
     F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
     F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
     
The triple invocation of LaTeX is to ensure that all references have been properly resolved and any page layout changes due to inserting the references have been accounted for. The sequence of commands isn't horrible, but it still is several commands. To use AutoLaTeX for this project, you would use one of the following the command lines:

     F<autolatex -f mydoc.tex>
     F<autolatex>
     
For documents which may need to run programs to create the PDF versions of the drawings included into the PDF document, or run BibTeX/Biber to generate bibliographies, the generation of the F<.pdf> (or Postscript) files becomes complicated to run manually. With AutoLaTeX, such operations are still very simple: you have nothing to do. AutoLaTeX is calling the translators and the tools for you. Each translator is able to convert a picture source file (eps, svg, Gnuplot...) into a PDF or PNG file.

Hopefully, this introduction has provided an adequate example for how AutoLaTeX can simplify the management of LaTeX-based documents. The AutoLaTeX system is simple enough for small projects and powerful enough for large projects. The remainder of this manual will provide complete documentation on the use of AutoLaTeX as well as configuration and installation instructions.

=head1 COMMANDS

AutoLaTeX provides a fixed set of commands, that should be passed to AutoLaTeX to run a specific set of actions on the document. The default command is B<all>.
Several commands have specific optional arguments. Please use B<--help> after the name of the command for obtaining details.

The commands provided by AutoLaTeX are:

=over 4


=item B<all>

Same as the command B<view>, except that the viewer is launched only if the configuration or the CLI is enabling the viewer.

=item B<biblio>

Perform all processing that permits to generate the bibliography (bibtex, biber...)

=item B<clean>

Clean the current working directory by removing all LaTeX temp files and other temp files created during processing of the project.

=item B<cleanall>

Same as the command B<clean>. In addition, emacs B<~> files and other backup files are removed. The generated figures and the produced PDF are also removed.
This command has the alias B<mrproper>.

=item B<createconfig>

Create a configuration file into the current directory. The content of the configuration file depends on the configuration defined on the command-line itself.

=item B<createist>

Create a default MakeIndex style file into the document directory. The created file will be named B<default.ist>.

=item B<commit>

Commit the changes into a SCM system (CVS, SVN, GIT).

=item B<documentation>

Performs all processing required to produce the file .pdf/.dvi/.ps for the project. This command has the alias B<gen_doc>.

=item B<glossaries>

Performs all processing that permits to generate the glossaries (makeglossaries). This command has the alias B<makeglossaries>.

=item B<images>

Performs the automatic generation of the drawings by invoking the tranlators.

=item B<index>

Performs all processing that permits to generate the index (makeindex). This command has the alias B<makeindex>.

=item B<init>

Create an empty LaTeX document into the current directory that is following a standard folder structure supported by AutoLaTeX.

=item B<makeflat>

Create a version of the document inside a specific folder (default is './flat_version/') in which there is a single TeX file, and all
the other files are inside the same directory of the TeX file, i.e. no subfolder is allowed. This command has the alias B<preparepublish>.

This command is helpful to create a version of the document that may be directly upload on online publication sites (such as Elsevier).
Indeed, these publisher's systems does not allow to upload the content of subfolders online.

This command provides the CLI option F<--externalbiblio> to determine if the bibliography must be put in a BibTeX file or inline inside the TeX file
(default is inline).

=item B<showconfig>

Display the configuration definition that is read from the different configuration files.

=item B<showconfigfiles>

Display the list of the configuration filenames that will be read by autolatex.

=item B<showimages>

Display the filenames of the figures that should be treated by a translator.
This action provides specific options for controlling the type of information that is output.

=item B<showinstalledtranslators>

Show the list of the installed translators. This command has the alias B<installedtranslators>.

=item B<showloadededtranslators>

Show the list of the loaded translators. This command has the alias B<translators>.

=item B<showpath>

Show the value of the environment variable PATH.

=item B<unusedimages>

Display (or remove) the figures that are inside the document folder but not included from the document.

=item B<update>

Update the local copy with the changes from a SCM system (CVS, SVN, GIT).

=item B<view>

Same as the command B<document>. In addition, this command launches the document viewer.

=back

=head1 GLOBAL OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<--asyncview>

=item B<--noasyncview>

Enable or disable the asynchronous launching of the viewer. If the viewer is launched asynchonously, AutoLaTeX does not wait
for its termination before stopping its execution. If the viewer is launched synchonously, AutoLaTeX waits for its termination
before stopping its execution.

=item B<--auto>

=item B<--noauto>

Enable or disable the automatic generation of the figures by using the translators.

=item B<--biblio>

=item B<--nobiblio>

Enable or disable the call to the bibliography tool (BibTeX, Biber...) if it not explicitly invoked from the command line.

=item B<--continuous [sleep_duration]>

=item B<--nocontinuous>

Do not stop AutoLaTeX, and continually do the action(s) given as parameter(s). This option causes AutoLaTeX to infinitely loop. It has the same effect as the
following script (in bash):

 while 1
 do
   autolatex "$@"
   sleep B<sleep_duration>
 done

The value B<sleep_duration> permits to add some waiting time between two loop of AutoLaTeX. If it is not given, 0 is assumed.
The B<--continuous> option force the option B<--asyncview> to be set.

With a good viewer the display will be automatically updated. (Under some but not all versions of UNIX/Linux "gv -watch"  does this  for  Postscript
files; this can be set by a configuration variable.) Many other previewers will need a manual update.

Important note: the Adobe Acroread program on MS-Windows locks the PDF file, and prevents new versions being written, so it is a bad
idea to use Adobe Acroread to view PDF files in continuous mode.

=item B<--debug>

Run AutoLaTeX with the logging level set to 'debug'. The different levels are (from less verbose to more verbose): off, critical,
error, warning, info, fine_info, debug, trace.

=item B<--defaultist>

Allow AutoLaTeX to use MakeIndex with the default style (ist file). The default style is provided by AutoLaTeX distribution.
The options B<--index> and B<--noindex> permit to change the behavior of AutoLaTeX regarding the used of MakeIndex.

=item B<-d F<directory>>

=item B<--directory F<directory>>

Specify a directory in which a LaTeX document to compile is located. You could specify this option for each directory in which you have
a LaTeX document to treat. If this option is not specified, the current directory is used.

=item B<--dvi>

The result of the AutoLaTeX process is a DVI or XDVI document, that will be converted to a Postscript document. This option has the same
effect has B<--ps>.

=item B<-e S<name>>

=item B<--exclude S<name>>

Avoid AutoLaTeX to load the translator called S<name>. See bellow for the available translators.
The option B<--include> permits to include a translator; and the option B<--include-path> permits to specify where to find translator scripts.

=item B<-f F<file>>

=item B<--file F<file>>

Specify the main LaTeX file to compile. If this option is not specified, AutoLaTeX will search for a TeX file in the document directory.

=item B<--file-line-warning>

=item B<--nofile-line-warning>

Enable or disable the extended format for LaTeX warnings. This format adds the filename and the line number where the warning is occuring,
before the warning message by itself. It is helpful for extracting the warning messages from the log file.

=item B<--gloss>

=item B<--glossary>

=item B<--nogloss>

=item B<--noglossary>

Enable or disable the use of MakeGlossaries.

=item B<-h>

=item B<--help>

Display the manual. If you write this option before any occurrence of a command, the global manual is dispplayed. If you use this option
after a command, only the manual page of the command is shown up.

=item B<-D S<directory>>

=item B<--imgdirectory S<directory>>

Specify a directory inside which AutoLaTeX will find the figures to be processed by the translators. Each time this option is put on the
command line, a directory is added inside the list of the directories to explore.

=item B<-i S<name>>

=item B<--include S<name>>

Force AutoLaTeX to load the translator called S<name>. See bellow for the available translators.
The option B<--exclude> permits to exclude a translator; and the option B<--include-path> permits to specify where to find translator scripts.

=item B<-I S<paths>>

=item B<--include-path S<paths>>

Notify AutoLaTeX that it could find translator scripts inside the specified directories. The specified S<paths> could be a list of paths separated
by the operating system's path separator (':' on Unix, ';' for Windows for example).
The option B<--exclude> permits to exclude a translator; and the option B<--include> permits to exclude a translator.

=item B<--index [F<style_file>]>

=item B<--noindex>

Allow AutoLaTeX to use MakeIndex. If this option was specified with a value, the F<style_file> value will be assumed to be an .ist file
to pass to MakeIndex. If this option was specified without a value, AutoLaTeX will use MakeIndex and tries to detect a MakeIndex style file
(.ist file) inside the document directory. If no document's .ist file was found, AutoLaTeX will not pass a style to MakeIndex.
The options B<--defaultist> and B<--noindex> permit to change the behavior of AutoLaTeX against MakeIndex.

=item B<--latex>

Use the LaTeX command: F<latex>. See also: B<--pdflatex>, B<--lualatex> and B<--xelatex>.

=item B<--lualatex>

Use the LaTeX command: F<lualatex>. See also: B<--pdflatex>, B<--latex> and B<--xelatex>.

=item B<--pdf>

=item B<--pdflatex>

Use the LaTeX command: F<pdflatex>. See also: B<--latex>, B<--lualatex> and B<--xelatex>.

=item B<--ps>

The result of the AutoLaTeX process is a Postscript document. This option has the same effect has B<--dvi>.

=item B<-q>

=item B<--quiet>

Run AutoLaTeX with only critical and error messages. The different levels are (from less verbose to more verbose): off, critical,
error, warning, info, fine_info, debug, trace.

=item B<--search-project-from F<file>>

When this option is specified, AutoLaTeX is searching a configuration file (usually F<.autolatex_project.cfg> on Unix platforms) in the
directory of the specified F<file> or in one of its ancestors. Using this option does not avoid you to use the B<d> or B<-f> options.

=item B<--silent>

Run AutoLaTeX without logging message (off logging level). The different levels are (from less verbose to more verbose): off, critical,
error, warning, info, fine_info, debug, trace.

=item B<--stderr>

=item B<--stdout>

AutoLaTeX will output the regular messages (those that are not printed out by the logging system) to the standard output (stdout) or
the standard error output (stderr).

=item B<--synctex>

=item B<--nosynctex>

Enable or disable the generation of the output file that are compatible with SyncTeX. SyncTeX is a system that is permitting to link a
viewer and the TeX editor. When you click in one, the other software is highlighting the corresponding line.

=item B<-v>

=item B<--verbose>

Each time this option was specified, AutoLaTeX is more verbose. The different levels of verbosity are (from less verbose to more verbose):
off, critical, error, warning, info, fine_info, debug, trace.

Note that if you would like to be more verbose than 'trace', AutoLaTeX is stopping immediately, and is displaying the current
configuration in memory.

error, warning, info, fine_info, debug, trace.

=item B<--Wnone>

Run AutoLaTeX with logging level set to 'error', i.e. without showing the warnings. The different levels are (from less verbose to more
verbose): off, critical, error, warning, info, fine_info, debug, trace.

=item B<--xelatex>

Use the LaTeX command: F<xelatex>. See also: B<--pdflatex>, B<--latex> and B<--lualatex>.

=head1 AUTO GENERATION OF FIGURES

A convertor, named translator, is used to convert a source figure into a target figure which is supported by LaTeX. This converter is an external program (eg. epstopdf) or an internal Python script (or Perl, Ruby, Bash script).

Each supported translator is described inside a F<.transdef2> file (old format has extension F<.transdef>). This file contains the definition of
the variables for the shell command line to launch or the code to use. To create a new translator, we recommend to copy/paste an existing F<.transdef2> file and change its content. Even if you excluded a translator from the the command line, it is automatically included by AutoLaTeX when it is invoked by an included translator.

The provided translators are:

=head1 LATEX STYLE PACKAGE

AutoLaTeX provides a LaTeX style called F<autolatex.sty>. It provides the following functions:

=over 4

=item B<\includegraphicswtex[options]{filename}>

Include a figure with combined TeX macros. The filename must have one of the following extensions: F<.pdftex_t>, F<.pdftex_t>, F<.pstex_t>,
F<.pdf_tex>, F<.ps_tex>. The B<options> must one of: F<width=XX>, or F<height=XX>; where F<XX> is a length.

=item B<\includefigurewtex[options]{filename}>

Same as B<\includegraphicswtex>.

=item B<\includeanimatedfigure[options]{filename}>

Include the layers of a figure in a Beamer presentation. The different layers are assumed to be in separate PDF files. The figure is then a TeX
file that is including the PDF files inside a Beamer-compatible environment. The filename must have one of the following extensions:
F<.pdftex_t>, F<.pdftex_t>, F<.pstex_t>, F<.pdf_tex>, F<.ps_tex>. The B<options> must one of: F<width=XX>, or F<height=XX>; where F<XX> is a length.

By default, a layer is replacing the previous layer when it is displayed. You could change the overlay specification by adding the string F<"spec">
in the title of the layer in your SVG editor. The F<spec> part is the specification of the slide numbers on which the layer should
appear in Beamer. For example, F<2> means 'only on the slide 2'; F<6-> means 'from slide 6 to the end'.

=item B<\includeanimatedfigurewtex[options]{filename}>

Include the layers of a figure combined with TeX macros in a Beamer presentation. The different layers are assumed to be in separate PDF files.
The figure is then a TeX file that is including the PDF files inside a Beamer-compatible environment.
The filename must have one of the following extensions: F<.pdftex_t>, F<.pdftex_t>, F<.pstex_t>, F<.pdf_tex>, F<.ps_tex>. The B<options> must
one of: F<width=XX>, or F<height=XX>; where F<XX> is a length.

By default, a layer is replacing the previous layer when it is displayed. You could change the overlay specification by adding the string F<"spec">
in the title of the layer in your SVG editor. The F<spec> part is the specification of the slide numbers on which the layer should appear in Beamer.
For example, F<2> means 'only on the slide 2'; F<6-> means 'from slide 6 to the end'.

=item B<\DeclareGraphicsExtensionsWtex{extensions}>

Permits to define the filename extensions that are used by B<\includegraphicswtex> to find the figure files.

=item B<\graphicspath{{path1},{path2}...}>

It is the macro from the TeX package 'graphicx.sty'. It permits to define the search paths for the figures.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

=head2 Location of the Configuration Files

The configuration files used by AutoLaTex could be a several places:

=over 4

=item * System Configuration (for all users): inside the directory where AutoLaTeX was installed (usually /usr/lib/autolatex on Unix systems).

=item * User Configuration: two cases: the configuration directory named S<$HOME/.autolatex> on Unix, or S<C:\Documents and Settings\E<lt>userE<gt>\Local Settings\Application Data\autolatex> on Windows exists; or not.

In the first case, the configuration file is stored inside the directory and is named S<autolatex.conf>.

In the second case, the configuration file is inside the user directory and is named S<$HOME/.autolatex> on Unix, and S<C:\Documents and Settings\E<lt>userE<gt>\Local Settings\Application Data\autolatex.conf> on Windows.

=item * Project Configuration: the configuration file in the same directory as the main TeX file of the project. It is named S<.autolatex_project.cfg> on Unix and S<autolatex_project.cfg> on Windows.

=back

=head2 Syntax of the Configuration Files

The configuration files respect a syntax similar to the Windows .ini files.

A comment starts with the characters '#' or ';' and it finishes at the end of the line.

Each configuration directive must be inside a configuration section. A configuration section
is declared by its name between brackets. Example: F<[mysection]>

Each directive must be declared as: F<directive name = value>

Several section names are reserved by AutoLaTeX, the others are assumed to be the configuration for the translators.

=head3 [Viewer] section

This section permits to configure the viewer used by AutoLaTeX.
The recognized directives are:

=over 4

=item I<view> : Indicates if AutoLaTeX must launch a viewer after LaTeX compilation. Accepted values: F<yes> or F<no>.
	
=item I<viewer> : Is the path or the command line of the viewer to launch. Accepted value: any command line.

=back

=head3 [Generation] section

This section permits to configure the generation process used by AutoLaTeX.
The recognized directives are:

=over 4

=item I<main file> : specifies the basename of the main TeX file to compile. This option is available only inside the project's configuration file.

=item I<generate images> : indicates if AutoLaTeX automatically generates the figures. Accepted values: F<yes> or F<no>

=item I<image directory> : Specify the directories inside which AutoLaTeX will find the pictures which must be processed by the translators. The different paths are separated by the path-separator character (F<':'> on Unix, F<';'> on Windows).

=item I<generation type> : indicates the type of generation. Accepted values:

=over 8

=item F<pdf> - generate a PDF document

=item F<dvi> - generate a DVI or a XDV document

=item F<ps> - generate a PS document

=back

=item I<tex compiler> : indicates the TeX compiler to use. Accepted values:

=over 8

=item F<latex> - use F<latex>

=item F<pdflatex> - use F<pdflatex>

=item F<xelatex> - use F<xelatex>

=item F<lualatex> - use F<lualatex>

=back

=item I<synctex> : indicates if the output document may be produced with SyncTeX, or not.

=item I<makeindex style> : specifies the style that must be used by MakeIndex. This is a list of values separated by comas, in the preference order. The values should be:

=over 8

=item F<E<lt>filenameE<gt>> - if a filename was specified, AutoLaTeX assumes that it is the .ist file;

=item F<@system> - AutoLaTeX uses the system default .ist file (in AutoLaTeX distribution);

=item F<@detect> - AutoLaTeX will tries to find a .ist file in the project's directory. If none was found, AutoLaTeX will not pass a style to makeindex;

=item F<@none> - AutoLaTeX assumes that no .ist file must be passed to MakeIndex;

=item F<E<lt>emptyE<gt>> - AutoLaTeX assumes that no .ist file must be passed to MakeIndex.

=back

If the list contains more than one value, AutoLaTeX will do the corresponding behaviors in turn.

=item I<translator include path> : specifies additional directories from which translator scripts could be loaded. This is a list of paths separated by comas or the path separator of your operating system (S<:> on Unix, S<;> on Windows). If a path contains a coma character, you must enclose it in quotes.

=item I<latex_cmd> : specifies the LaTeX tool command line. Accepted value: any command line.

=item I<bibtex_cmd> : specifies the BibTeX tool command line. Accepted value: any command line.

=item I<biber_cmd> : specifies the Biber tool command line. Accepted value: any command line.

=item I<makeglossaries_cmd> : specifies the MakeGlossaries tool command line. Accepted value: any command line.

=item I<makeindex_cmd> : specifies the MakeIndex tool command line. Accepted value: any command line.

=item I<dvi2ps_cmd> : specifies the dvips tool command line. Accepted value: any command line.

=item I<latex_flags> : specifies the options to pass to the LaTeX tool. Accepted value: any command line.
