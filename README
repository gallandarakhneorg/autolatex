NAME
    autolatex - compile TeX documents

SYNOPSIS
    autolatex [options] target [target ...]

DESCRIPTION
    AutoLaTeX is a tool for managing small to large sized LaTeX documents.
    The user can easily perform all required steps to do such tasks as:
    preview the document, or produce a PDF file. AutoLaTeX will keep track
    of files that have changed and how to run the various programs that are
    needed to produce the output. One of the best feature of AutoLaTeX is to
    provide translator rules (aka. translators) to automatically generate
    the figures which will be included into the PDF.

    As a quick example, consider a project, which has a single LaTeX file
    mydoc.tex, as its input. Without AutoLaTeX, to produce a .pdf file you
    might use the following sequence of commands:

         F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
         F<bibtex mydoc.tex>
         F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
         F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>
         F<pdflatex mydoc.tex>

    The triple invocation of LaTeX is to ensure that all references have
    been properly resolved and any page layout changes due to inserting the
    references have been accounted for. The sequence of commands isn't
    horrible, but it still is several commands. To use AutoLaTeX for this
    project, you would use one of the following the command lines:

         F<autolatex -f mydoc.tex>
         F<autolatex>

    For documents, which may need to run programs to create the PDF versions
    of the drawings, which are included into the PDF document, or run
    BibTeX/Biber to generate bibliographies, the generation of the .pdf (or
    other) files becomes increasingly complicated to run manually. With
    AutoLaTeX, such operations are still very simple: you have nothing to
    do. AutoLaTeX is calling the translators for you. Each translator is
    able to convert an picture source file (eps, svg, Gnuplot...) into a PDF
    or PNG file.

    Hopefully this introduction has provided an adequate example for how
    AutoLaTeX can simplify the management of LaTeX-based documents. The
    AutoLaTeX system is simple enough for small projects and powerful enough
    for large projects. The remainder of this manual will provide complete
    documentation on the use of AutoLaTeX as well as configuration and
    installation instructions.

    AutoLaTeX provides several graphical user interfaces. See the section
    below for details.

TARGETS
    AutoLaTeX provides a fixed set of targets, the arguments to pass to
    AutoLaTeX to run a module, for all projects. The default target is all.

    If the specified target is not recognized by AutoLaTeX, a program name
    "autolatex-target" (where "target" is replaced by the given target
    string) is searched on your system, and launched. For example,
    "autolatex config" permits to launch the graphical user interface for
    configuring AutoLaTeX. This interface is supported by the program
    "autolatex-config", which is provided in the AutoLaTeX distribution.

    The targets provided by AutoLaTeX are:

    all Same as view, except that the viewer is launched only if the
        configuration or the CLI is enabling the viewer.

    biblio
        Performs all processing that permits to generate the bibliography
        (bibtex, biber...)

    clean
        Cleans the current working directory by removing all LaTeX temp
        files and other temp files created during processing of the project.

    cleanall
        Same as clean. In addition, emacs ~ files and other backup files are
        removed. The generated figures and the produced PDF are also
        removed.

    commit
        Commit the changes into a SCM system (CVS, SVN, GIT).

    gen_doc
        Performs all processing required to produce the file .pdf/.dvi/.ps
        for the project.

    images
        Performs the automatic generation of the figures.

    init
        Create an empty LaTeX document that is following a standard folder
        structure supported by AutoLaTeX.

    makeflat
        Create a version of the document inside the subdirectory
        'flat_version' in which there is a single TeX file, and all the
        other files are inside the same directory of the TeX file. This
        action is helpful to create a version of the document that may be
        directly upload on online publication sites (such as Elsevier). This
        action use the CLI option --biblio to determine if the bibliography
        must be put in a BibTeX file or inline inside the TeX file (default
        is inline).

        If you do not want to output the flat version in a subdirectory
        named 'flat_version', you could set the output directory or the
        output basename.

        To change the output path for the flat version, you could use the
        CLI option:

        --set makeflat.output=*path*

        To change only the basename of the output path for the flat version,
        you must use the CLI option:

        --set makeflat.basename=*name*

    makeglossaries
        Performs all processing that permits to generate the glossaries
        (makeglossaries).

    makeindex
        Performs all processing that permits to generate the index
        (makeindex).

    showimages
        Display the filenames of the figures.

    showimagemap
        Display the filenames of the figures, and for each of them, the
        selected translator.

    showpath
        Show the value of the environment variable PATH

    update
        Update the local copy with the changes from a SCM system (CVS, SVN,
        GIT).

    view
        Same as gen_doc. In addition launch the document viewer.

OPTIONS
    --[no]auto
        Enable or disable the auto generation of the figures.

    --[no]asyncview
        Enable or disable the asynchronous launching of the viewer. If the
        viewer is launched asynchonously, AutoLaTeX does not wait for its
        termination before stopping its execution. If the viewer is launched
        synchonously, AutoLaTeX waits for its termination before stopping
        its execution.

    --[no]biblio
        Enable or disable the call to the bibliography tool (BibTeX,
        Biber...)

    --continuous[=sleep_duration]
    --nocontinuous
        Do not stop AutoLaTeX, and continually do the action(s) given as
        parameter(s). This option causes AutoLaTeX to infinitely loop. It
        has the same effect as the following script (in bash): while 1 do
        autolatex "$@" sleep sleep_duration done

        The value sleep_duration permits to add some waiting time between
        two loop of AutoLaTeX. If it is not given, 0 is assumed. The
        --continuous option force the option --asyncview to be set.

        With a good viewer the display will be automatically updated. (Under
        some but not all versions of UNIX/Linux "gv -watch" does this for
        Postscript files; this can be set by a configuration variable.) Many
        other previewers will need a manual update.

        Important note: the acroread program on MS-Windows locks the PDF
        file, and prevents new versions being written, so it is a bad idea
        to use acroread to view PDF files in continuous mode.

    --createconfig[=type]
        Do not compile the LaTeX document, but create a configuration file.
        The created configuration file depends on the type value. If the
        type is equal to project, AutoLaTeX will create the configuration
        file dedicated to a project. Otherwhise it will create the
        configuration file for the user level. The project configuration
        file is path/to/project/.autolatex_project.cfg on Unix platforms,
        and path\to\project\autolatex_project.cfg on other platforms. The
        default user configuration file is $HOME/.autolatex on Unix
        platforms, C:\Documents and Settings\User\Local Settings\Application
        Data\autolatex.conf on Windows platforms, and $HOME/autolatex.conf
        on other plateforms.

    --createist
        Create a default MakeIndex style file into the project directory.
        The created file will be named 'default.ist'. If a file with this
        name already is existing, it will be overwritten.

    --debug
        Run AutoLaTeX in debug mode. The verbose level is 5, and all the
        warnings in the Perl code are assumed to be errors.

    --defaultist
        Allow AutoLaTeX to use MakeIndex with the default style (ist file).
        The default style is provided by AutoLaTeX.

        The options --index and --noindex also permit to change the behavior
        of AutoLaTeX against MakeIndex.

    --directory=directory
        Specify a directory in which a LaTeX document to compile is located.
        You could specify this option for each directory in which you have a
        LaTeX document to treat.

    --dvi
        Do the compilation to produce a DVI or a XDV document.

    --exclude=name
        Avoid AutoLaTeX to load the translator called name. See bellow for
        the available translators.

        The option --include permits to include a translator; and the option
        -I permits to specify where to find translator scripts.

    -f=file
    --file=file
        Specify the main LaTeX file to compile. If this option is not
        specified, AutoLaTeX will search for a TeX file in the current
        directory.

    --file-line-warning
        Enable or disable the extended format for warnings. This format add
        the filename and the line number where the warning is occuring,
        before the warning message by itself.

    --fixconfig[=file]
        Fix the syntax of a configuration file. If the file is not specified
        on the command line, AutoLaTeX will try to fix the project
        configuration, or the user configuration if no project configuration
        file was found.

    --gloss
        Allow AutoLaTeX to use MakeGlossaries.

        The option --nogloss permits to change the behavior of AutoLaTeX
        against MakeGlossaries

    -?
    --help
        Display this manual.

    -I=paths
        Notify AutoLaTeX that it could find translator scripts inside the
        specified directories. The specified path could be a list of paths
        separated by the operating system's path separator (':' on Unix, ';'
        for Windows for example).

        The option --exclude permits to exclude a translator; and the option
        --include permits to exclude a translator.

    --imgdirectory=directory
        Specify a directy inside which AutoLaTeX will find the pictures
        which must be processed by the translators. Each time this option is
        put on the command line, a directory is added inside the list of the
        directories to explore.

    --include=name
        Force AutoLaTeX to load the translator called name. See bellow for
        the available translators.

        The option --exclude permits to exclude a translator; and the option
        -I permits to specify where to find translator scripts.

    --index[=style_file]
        Allow AutoLaTeX to use MakeIndex.

        If this option was specified with a value, the style_file value will
        be assumed to be an .ist file to pass to MakeIndex.

        If this option was specified without a value, AutoLaTeX will use
        MakeIndex and tries to detect a MakeIndex style file (.ist file)
        inside the project directory. If no project's .ist file was found,
        AutoLaTeX will not pass a style to MakeIndex.

        The options --defaultist and --noindex also permit to change the
        behavior of AutoLaTeX against MakeIndex

    --latex
        Use the historical LaTeX command: latex.

    --lualatex
        Use the LaTeX command: lualatex.

    --nogloss
        Avoid AutoLaTeX to use MakeGloassaries.

        The option --gloss also permits to change the behavior of AutoLaTeX
        against MakeGlossaries.

    --noindex
        Avoid AutoLaTeX to use MakeIndex.

        The options --index and --defaultist also permit to change the
        behavior of AutoLaTeX against MakeIndex.

    --pdf
        Do the compilation to produce a PDF document.

    --pdflatex
        Use the LaTeX command: pdflatex.

    --postcompilationruns[=n]
        Defines the minimal number of times the LaTeX tool (usually
        pdflatex) is launched at the last AutoLaTeX running stage. The
        default value is 1.

        This command line option enables you to force AutoLaTeX to run the
        LaTeX tool more than once time for fixing some LaTeX issues in
        references.

    --progress[=n]
        Enable or disable the progression indicator. The value of the
        parameter permits to determine what is the character that will be
        print out at the end of the lines. By default, the carriage-return
        character "\r" is used. If you specify a value equals to ""n"", the
        new-line character "\n" will be used.

    --ps
        Do the compilation to produce a Postscript document, when possible.

    -q
    --quiet
        AutoLaTeX should be not verbose (see -v for changing the verbose
        level).

    --search-project-from=file
        When this option is specified, AutoLaTeX is searching a project
        configuration file (usually .autolatex_project.cfg on Unix
        platforms) in the directory of the specified file or in one of its
        ancestors. When the project configuration file was found, AutoLaTeX
        assumes that the building directory is the directory where the
        configuration file is located.

    --set [translator.]name=value
        Set the internal value of AutoLaTeX named name with the specified
        value. Internal values are limited and corresponds to the "set"
        directives from the configuration file syntax.

        If translator is given, it is the name of the translator for which
        the value must ve overridden. If translator is not given then
        "generation" is the default prefix.

    --stderr
        Prefer to output the messages on the standard error output.

    --stdout
        Prefer to output the messages on the standard output.

    --[no]synctex
        Enable or disable the generation of the output file with SyncTeX.
        SyncTeX is a system that is permitting to link a viewer and the TeX
        editor. When you click in one, the other software is highlighting
        the corresponding line.

    -v  Each time this option was specified, AutoLaTeX is more verbose. Note
        that 1) if you put 5 times the -v option on the command line,
        AutoLaTeX will consider the Perl warnings as errors; 2) if you put 6
        times the -v option on the command line, AutoLaTeX is stopping
        immediately, and is displaying the current configuration in memory.

    --version
        Display the version of AutoLaTeX.

    --view[=file]
    --noview
        Enable or disable the document viewer at the end of the compilation.
        The path of the document viewer could be specify with file. If not
        specified, AutoLaTeX will check for the tools acroread, kpdf,
        evince, gv, and xpdf.

    -W
    --Wall
    --Wnone
        Select the warnings that should be output: --Wall for all, --Wnone
        for none, and -W to increment the output level. -W is the default
        configuration used by AutoLaTeX.

    --xelatex
        Use the LaTeX command: xelatex.

AUTO GENERATION OF FIGURES
    A translator is used to convert a source figure into a target figure
    which is supported by LaTeX. This converter is an external program (eg.
    epstopdf) or an internal Perl script.

    Each supported translator is described inside a .transdef file. This
    file contains the definition of the variables for the shell command line
    to launch or the Perl code to use. To create a new translator, we
    recommend to copy/paste an existing .transdef file and change its
    content. Even if you excluded a translator from the the command line, it
    is automatically included by AutoLaTeX when it is invoked by an included
    translator.

    The provided translators are:

LATEX STYLE PACKAGE
    AutoLaTeX provides a LaTeX style called autolatex.sty. It provides the
    following functions:

    \includegraphicswtex[options]{filename}
        include a figure with combined TeX macros. The filename must have
        one of the following extensions: .pdftex_t, .pdftex_t, .pstex_t,
        .pdf_tex, .ps_tex. The options must one of: width=XX, or height=XX;
        where XX is a length.

    \includefigurewtex[options]{filename}
        same as \includegraphicswtex.

    \includeanimatedfigure[options]{filename}
        include the layers of a figure in a Beamer presentation. The
        different layers are assumed to be in separate PDF files. The figure
        is then a TeX file that is including the PDF files inside a
        Beamer-compatible environment. The filename must have one of the
        following extensions: .pdftex_t, .pdftex_t, .pstex_t, .pdf_tex,
        .ps_tex. The options must one of: width=XX, or height=XX; where XX
        is a length.

        By default, a layer is replacing the previous layer when it is
        displayed. You could change the overlay specification by adding the
        string "spec" in the title of the layer in your SVG editor. The spec
        part is the specification of the slide numbers on which the layer
        should appear in Beamer. For example, 2 means 'only on the slide 2';
        6- means 'from slide 6 to the end'.

    \includeanimatedfigurewtex[options]{filename}
        include the layers of a figure combined with TeX macros in a Beamer
        presentation. The different layers are assumed to be in separate PDF
        files. The figure is then a TeX file that is including the PDF files
        inside a Beamer-compatible environment. The filename must have one
        of the following extensions: .pdftex_t, .pdftex_t, .pstex_t,
        .pdf_tex, .ps_tex. The options must one of: width=XX, or height=XX;
        where XX is a length.

        By default, a layer is replacing the previous layer when it is
        displayed. You could change the overlay specification by adding the
        string "spec" in the title of the layer in your SVG editor. The spec
        part is the specification of the slide numbers on which the layer
        should appear in Beamer. For example, 2 means 'only on the slide 2';
        6- means 'from slide 6 to the end'.

    \DeclareGraphicsExtensionsWtex{extensions}
        permits to define the filename extensions that are used by
        \includegraphicswtex to find the figure files.

    \graphicspath{{path1},{path2}...}
        is the macros from the TeX package 'graphicx.sty'. It permits to
        define the search paths for the figures.

CONFIGURATION FILE
  Location of the Configuration Files
    The configuration files used by AutoLaTex could be a several places:

    *   System Configuration (for all users): inside the directory where
        AutoLaTeX was installed (usually /usr/lib/autolatex on Unix
        systems).

    *   User Configuration: two cases: the configuration directory named
        $HOME/.autolatex on Unix, or C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Local
        Settings\Application Data\autolatex on Windows exists; or not.

        In the first case, the configuration file is stored inside the
        directory and is named autolatex.conf.

        In the second case, the configuration file is inside the user
        directory and is named $HOME/.autolatex on Unix, and C:\Documents
        and Settings\<user>\Local Settings\Application Data\autolatex.conf
        on Windows.

    *   Project Configuration: the configuration file in the same directory
        as the main TeX file of the project. It is named
        .autolatex_project.cfg on Unix and autolatex_project.cfg on Windows.

  Syntax of the Configuration Files
    The configuration files respect a syntax similar to the Windows .ini
    files.

    A comment starts with the characters '#' or ';' and it finishes at the
    end of the line.

    Each configuration directive must be inside a configuration section. A
    configuration section is declared by its name between brackets. Example:
    [mysection]

    Each directive must be declared as: directive name = value

    Several section names are reserved by AutoLaTeX, the others are assumed
    to be the configuration for the translators.

   [Viewer] section
    This section permits to configure the viewer used by AutoLaTeX. The
    recognized directives are:

    *view* : Indicates if AutoLaTeX must launch a viewer after LaTeX
    compilation. Accepted values: yes or no.
    *viewer* : Is the path or the command line of the viewer to launch.
    Accepted value: any command line.

   [Generation] section
    This section permits to configure the generation process used by
    AutoLaTeX. The recognized directives are:

    *main file* : specifies the basename of the main TeX file to compile.
    This option is available only inside the project's configuration file.
    *generate images* : indicates if AutoLaTeX automatically generates the
    figures. Accepted values: yes or no
    *image directory* : Specify the directories inside which AutoLaTeX will
    find the pictures which must be processed by the translators. The
    different paths are separated by the path-separator character (':' on
    Unix, ';' on Windows).
    *generation type* : indicates the type of generation. Accepted values:

        pdf - generate a PDF document
        dvi - generate a DVI or a XDV document
        ps - generate a PS document

    *tex compiler* : indicates the TeX compiler to use. Accepted values:

        latex - use latex
        pdflatex - use pdflatex
        xelatex - use xelatex
        lualatex - use lualatex

    *synctex* : indicates if the output document may be produced with
    SyncTeX, or not.
    *makeindex style* : specifies the style that must be used by MakeIndex.
    This is a list of values separated by comas, in the preference order.
    The values should be:

        <filename> - if a filename was specified, AutoLaTeX assumes that it
        is the .ist file;
        @system - AutoLaTeX uses the system default .ist file (in AutoLaTeX
        distribution);
        @detect - AutoLaTeX will tries to find a .ist file in the project's
        directory. If none was found, AutoLaTeX will not pass a style to
        makeindex;
        @none - AutoLaTeX assumes that no .ist file must be passed to
        MakeIndex;
        <empty> - AutoLaTeX assumes that no .ist file must be passed to
        MakeIndex.

        If the list contains more than one value, AutoLaTeX will do the
        corresponding behaviors in turn.

    *translator include path* : specifies additional directories from which
    translator scripts could be loaded. This is a list of paths separated by
    comas or the path separator of your operating system (: on Unix, ; on
    Windows). If a path contains a coma character, you must enclose it in
    quotes.
    *latex_cmd* : specifies the LaTeX tool command line. Accepted value: any
    command line.
    *bibtex_cmd* : specifies the BibTeX tool command line. Accepted value:
    any command line.
    *biber_cmd* : specifies the Biber tool command line. Accepted value: any
    command line.
    *makeglossaries_cmd* : specifies the MakeGlossaries tool command line.
    Accepted value: any command line.
    *makeindex_cmd* : specifies the MakeIndex tool command line. Accepted
    value: any command line.
    *dvi2ps_cmd* : specifies the dvips tool command line. Accepted value:
    any command line.
    *latex_flags* : specifies the options to pass to the LaTeX tool.
    Accepted value: any command line.
    *bibtex_flags* : specifies the options to pass to the BibTeX tool.
    Accepted value: any command line.
    *biber_flags* : specifies the options to pass to the Biber tool.
    Accepted value: any command line.
    *makeglossaries_flags* : specifies the options to pass to the
    MakeGlossaries tool. Accepted value: any command line.
    *makeindex_flags* : specifies the options to pass to the MakeIndex tool.
    Accepted value: any command line.
    *dvi2ps_flags* : specifies the options to pass to the dvips tool.
    Accepted value: any command line.

   [Clean] section
    This section permits to configure the cleaning features of AutoLaTeX
    (targets clean and cleanall). The recognized directives are:

    *files to clean* : is a list of files to remove when the target 'clean'
    is invoked. Shell wildcards are allowed.
    *files to desintegrate* : is a list of files to remove when the target
    'cleanall' is invoked. Shell wildcards are allowed.

   [Scm] section
    This section permits to configure the SCM support of AutoLaTeX (CVS, SVN
    or others). The recognized directives are:

    *scm commit* : specifies the command line to use when commit the
    changes.
    *scm update* : specified the command line to use when update the local
    copy.

   Translator section
    A translator section has the same name as the translator it configures.
    The recognized directives are:

    *include module* : indicates if the translator should be loaded by
    default. Accepted values: yes or no.
    *files to convert* : indicates a list of files that must be converter
    this this translator. The files are separated by the path separator
    given by the operating systems (':' on Unix, ';' on Windows).

GRAPHIC USER INTERFACE
    A graphical user interface is available since version 5.0 to configure
    and launch AutoLaTeX process.

    The available user interfaces are:

    Gedit 3:
        This is the *official* and up-to-date UI of AutoLaTeX. A plugin for
        the lightweight editor Gedit 3 <https://projects.gnome.org/gedit> is
        provided. You could launch AutoLaTeX and configure it through the
        differents provided panels.

    Standalone Gtk 3 Frontend:
        This front end is based on the Gtk3 library. It provides the same
        configuration windows as the Gedit 3 plugin. Indeed, both of them
        are using the same background API based on Gtk3.

    Sublime Text with LaTeXTools:
        Since 2014, AutoLaTeX is integrated as one of the builders of the
        LaTeXTools plugin <https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools> for
        Sublime Text. You could launch AutoLaTeX through the building tools
        of Sublime Text. Until now, it is not possible to configure
        AutoLaTeX through Sublime Text.

    Kile:
        There is no specific plugin for Kile. To use AutoLaTeX in this
        editor, you must add a build tool from the "Configure Kile" dialog
        box, or inside the kilerc file in the configuration directory of KDE
        (usually: "$HOME/.kde/share/config/kilerc"). We recommend the
        following configuration to launch AutoLaTeX in Kile (it is a copy of
        the content of the file kilerc):

         ...
         [Tool/AutoLaTeX/Default]
         class=Compile
         close=no
         command=autolatex
         menu=Compile
         options=-v --synctex --noview --search-project-from '%source' all
         state=Editor
         type=Process
         ...

    TeXmaker:
        There is no specific plugin for TeXmaker. To use AutoLaTeX in this
        editor, you must add a build tool inside the "Configure TeXmaker"
        dialog box, or inside the texmaker.ini file in the configuration
        directory of TeXMaker (usually: "$HOME/.config/xm1/texmaker.ini").
        We recommend the following configuration to launch AutoLaTeX in
        TeXmaker (it is a copy of the content of the file texmaker.ini):

         ...
         [texmaker]
         ...
         Tools\Userquick=autolatex -v --synctex --noview --search-project-from %.tex
         ...

    TeXworks:
        There is no specific plugin for TeXworks. To use AutoLaTeX in this
        editor, you must add a composition tool from the "Preferences"
        dialog box, or inside the tools.ini file in the configuration
        directory of TeXworks (usually:
        "$HOME/.TeXWorks/configuration/tools.ini"). We recommend the
        following configuration to launch AutoLaTeX in TeXworks (it is a
        copy of the content of the file tools.ini):

         ...
         [012]
         name=AutoLaTeX
         program=autolatex
         arguments=-v, --synctex, --noview, --search-project-from, $fullname, all
         showPdf=true
         ...

    The following graphical user interfaces are still provided, but they are
    deprecated:

    Gedit 2:
        A plugin for the lightweight editor Gedit 2.

    Sublime Text 2:
        A plugin for the editor Sublime Text 2
        <http://www.sublimetext.com/2>.

    Standalone Gtk 2 Frontend:
        A collection of configuration windows written in Perl and based on
        Gtk 2.

BUG REPORT AND FEEDBACK
    To report bugs, provide feedback, suggest new features, etc. (in
    prefered order): a) visit the developer site on GitHub
    <https://github.com/gallandarakhneorg/autolatex/>, b) visit the
    AutoLaTeX main page <http://www.arakhne.org/autolatex/>, or c) send
    email to the main author at galland@arakhne.org.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
    AutoLaTeX may be directly used from any directory where it is
    uncompressed. But you may want to compile and install the additional
    files (manual...)

    To configure and install AutoLaTeX, you may need GNU make.

    You need to install the package Compress::Zlib to compile and install
    AutoLaTeX. This package is not required for the execution of AutoLaTeX.
    In addition, to compile AutoLaTeX, you need to install the 'msgfmt'
    command which is a part of 'gettext'.

    To use AutoLaTeX, you will require:

    latex. The development of AutoLaTeX was done using the TeX Live
    distribution.
    Either Perl version 5.004 or higher.
    Several Perl packages usually installed in your Perl distribution:
    Config::Simple, Locale::gettext, Spec::File...

INSTALLATION
    Installation of AutoLaTeX consists of launching the Makefile.PL script
    to generate a Makefile that permits to compile and install AutoLaTeX.
    The basic commands are:

    cd path_to_autoloader_sources/

    perl ./Makefile.PL --prefix=/usr

    make

    make install

    make clean

    The file "INSTALL" gives more details on the installation, and it
    provides other ways to compile/install AutoLaTeX.
